This is YAFF, a framework for creating advanced web applications easily.

Consider YAFF an alternative to JSP pages. Java coders can code Java (which
produces XML), while HTML coders code their HTML using XSLT.

YAFF is a plugin for XINS (or more specifically, a "calling convention" in
XINS-terminology) and has been used in production websites since 2007.
This software is available under the terms of a BSD-style license, see
the accompanied COPYRIGHT file.

A YAFF application has all the advantages of a regular XINS application,
including lots of operations-oriented functionality. E.g. runtime statistics,
test forms, JSON-support, JSON-RPC-support, etc.


BUILDING YAFF

To build YAFF, use Apache Ant (version 1.7.1 works) and execute:

   ant

Under the target/ directory files will be generated, including a JAR file and
Javadoc API documentation.
